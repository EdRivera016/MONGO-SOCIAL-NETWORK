## Description
This project is a social network API built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It provides a RESTful API for managing users, thoughts, reactions, and friends in a social network.

## The Challenge
The challenge was to build a robust backend for a social network application that allows users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage a friend list. The application needed to support CRUD operations and handle associations between different entities efficiently.

## User Story
- AS A social media startup
- I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
- SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a social network API
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
- THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
